2. Actually there is also tray on the left side

5. found sharpen shortcut (ctrl + alt tab on object)

7. can use alt to on insert brush to flip the comp (can do substract bool with dynamesh)
8. use lower subdiv for faster edit
9. subtool > geometry > modify topology > del hidden
    Alt + move brush will move it towards the normal direction"

Subdivision vs Dynamesh,https://pixologic.com/zclassroom/workshop/subdivision-vs-dynamesh,1,1,getting started,1,ZbrushCore,"Dynamesh for setting up default shape before retopo, and can use and blend IMM brushes,
Harder to move if too many polygon

Subdiv could be done after retopo, can use IMM brushes,
Easier to move at lower subdiv"
